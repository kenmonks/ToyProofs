      <p>Welcome to Scrambler! The object of the game is to scramble a nice
      orderly pattern of numbers or colors to produce a given sequence. You
      always start with $1,2,3,\ldots,n$ for some small number $n$. On
      each of your turns you can apply one of the available rules to your
      current sequence to construct another sequence (which becomes your new
      current sequence). The list of available rules is different for each
      level of the game. It may require some study and investigation on your
      part to come up with an efficient strategy for beating this game at the
      higher levels of difficulty.</p>

      <h2>Game Components</h2>

      <p>As described in the <a href='Introduction.html'>Introduction</a>, this
      game illustrates the basic features of a formal proof system.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Toys:</b> The toys in this game consist of a list of the numbers
        $1,2,3,\ldots,n$ for some small number $n$, listed in a specific
        order from left to right. (<i>Such a list is called a
        <b>permutation</b> of the numbers $1,2,...,n$ in mathematics.</i>)
        You can also view the list as a sequence of colors or shaded numbered
        boxes by pressing <i>V</i></li>

        <li><b>A Goal:</b> The goal is a randomly selected ordering of the
        numbers. The object of game is to produce this list by scrambling the
        starting list.</li>

        <li><b>The Starting Position:</b> The starting position in this game is
        always the list consisting of the numbers $1,2,3,\ldots,n$ in increasing
        order from least to greatest. This is the only toy on your list when
        you begin the game.</li>

        <li>
          <b>The Rules:</b> The rules you can use to change the order of the
          numbers in the current list are different in each level of the game,
          and are listed under the <b>Moves</b> menu. It is up to you to
          determine what the various moves do for each level by
          experimentation.

          <ul>
            <li><b>Inputs:</b> The input for both Rules consists of the current
            list of numbers. The current list of numbers is always the last
            number list on the table. You can undo a move and go back to a
            previously constructed number by pressing <i>U</i></li>

            <li><b>Output:</b> The output is the list of numbers produced by
            applying one of the Rules to the current number. This number is
            added to the bottom of the list and becomes the current number. If
            it matches the goal, you win!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Math Behind the Fun</h2>

      <p>This game is closely related to the branch of mathematics known as
      group theory. In particular, each level illustrates a the action of a
      different group on the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n$</i>. Note that it is known
      that not all ordered lists can be obtained by applying the given rules in
      some order. Fortunately, the game only picks goals which can be achieved.
      So you can be confident that there is a way to win the game, even if you
      can't find it.</p>

      <p>Like Rubik's cube, the object of this game is to use certain available
      moves to try to put some colors into a particular arrangement. For
      Rubik's cube, the available moves consist of twisting a face of the cube
      by 90Â°. In Scrambler the colors are arranged in a row, rather than on the
      face of a cube, and the available moves are those given by the buttons
      labeled <b>Moves</b>.</p>

      <p>Two words of warning. First, the last level can be extremely difficult
      (we've only solved it in theory, not in practice!). The other levels are
      all doable by hand if you play with them and study them enough. Finally,
      this game is very addictive! You have been warned!</p>
