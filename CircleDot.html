      <p>Welcome to Circle-Dot! The object of the game is to construct a
      <i>circle-dot word</i> made of entirely $\bigcirc$'s and $\bullet$'s.
      You do not have any words to begin with. On each of your turns you can
      apply one of the five available rules to your current list of
      constructed circle-dot words to produce a new word. It may require some
      study and investigation on your part to come up with an efficient strategy
      for beating this game at the higher levels of difficulty.</p>

      <h2>Game Components</h2>

      <p>As described in the <a href='Introduction.html'>Introduction</a>, this
      game illustrates the basic features of a formal proof system.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Toys:</b> The toys in this game consist of a string of one or
        more circles and/or dots, called a circle-dot word.</li>

        <li><b>A Goal:</b> The goal is a randomly selected circle-dot word. The
        object of the game is to produce this word.</li>

        <li><b>The Starting Position:</b> The starting position in this game is
        always empty. There are no toys available to you to begin with.</li>

        <li>
          <b>The Rules:</b> There are five rules you can use to create new
          circle-dot words. They are the same five rules in every level of the
          game and are listed under the <b>Moves</b> menu.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Inputs:</b> Two of the five rules are called <i>Axioms</i>.
              These two rules require no inputs. Thus you can apply them at any
              time to construct the word they output.

              <p>The remaining three rules require previously constructed
              circle-dot words as their input. The input circle-dot words can
              be any of those on the list of words you have already produced.
              These inputs must be in a certain form determined by the values
              of some 'parameters' $W$ and $V$ which you must specify as
              circle-dot words. You cannot apply one of these rules unless all
              of the inputs you have specified are already available in your list
              of constructed words. You can change your mind and stop an attempt
              at applying one of these rules by pressing <i>C</i>. You can
              undo a move and go back to a previously constructed number by
              pressing <i>U</i>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Output:</b> The output is a single circle-dot word produced
            by applying one of the Rules, and specified by your choice of the
            values of the parameters $W$ and $V$ . This new word is added to the
            bottom of the list of words you have constructed and becomes
            immediately available as a possible input for subsequent rule
            applications. If the output word matches the goal, you win!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Math Behind the Fun</h2>

      <p>This game is much more similar to actual formal mathematical proofs
      than the other games in the Toy Proofs collection. The circle-dot words
      correspond to <em>mathematical statements</em>. The goal word is the
      statement we are trying to prove. Each rule is called a <em>rule of
      inference</em>. The output of a rule is called the <em>conclusion</em> of
      that rule. We say that the word produced by that rule is <em>deduced</em>
      or <em>follows from</em> the inputs by that rule of inference. The list
      of words we construct correspond to the statements in our proof, each of
      which is justified by a reason. The reason consists of the name of the
      rule that is used to deduce that line followed by the line numbers of the
      previously proven statements that are used as inputs to that rule.</p>

      <p>Like many actual rules of inference in logic, the circle-dot rules
      have parameters that must be supplied by the person doing the proof in
      order to apply the rule. As in ordinary rules of inference these
      parameters are often statements in that formal proof system, but in
      general they do not have to be.</p>

      <p>Since circle-dot strings clearly have no intrinsic meaning to us, they
      illustrate that we we can prove statements in a formal system without
      assigning <em>any meaning</em> to those statements whatsoever. Verifying
      that a particular statement can be proven in a formal system is a purely
      mechanical, algorithmic one. In this way we can achieve one of the two
      goals of a mathematical proof mentioned in the <a href=
      "Introduction.html">introduction</a>: Objectivity. Whether we can produce
      a particular circle-dot word or not in the game is not dependent at all
      on any intuitive meanings we might want to assign to them. Thus even if
      two people have slightly different intuitive impressions about what a
      particular circle-dot word means ("<i>I think</i> $\bigcirc\bullet\bigcirc$
      <i>means 'eyeglasses'"</i>) it will not have any affect on whether or not
      it can be proven in the game.</p>

      <p>In mathematics, we usually do have meaning assigned to our statements.
      Indeed, assigning meaning to the statements often will be your best guide
      in figuring out how to prove a given statement. Indeed, one of the main
      long term goals of our proofs should be to provide an intuitive
      explanation of why the particular statement is true. However, formal
      proof systems allow us to prove those statements no matter what meaning
      we might choose to assign to them... or even if we chose to assign no
      meaning to the statements at all. This gives us the objectivity we desire
      and has a secondary benefit that we are free to assign whatever meanings
      we like to our statements as long as they are practical and useful to us.
      In this way, we can say with confidence that while we may not know what
      we mean by our statements... we know that we are right!</p>
