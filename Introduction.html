      <h1>You want proof? I'll show you proof!</h1>

      <p>Mathematical proofs have a special place in the spectrum of human
      knowledge. In no other field are the claims so certain, the conclusions
      so universally accepted as correct. Why is this? What is the secret
      behind mathematical proofs that accounts for their incredible
      success?</p>

      <h2>Intuition and Objectivity</h2>

      <p>There are two traits which characterize a good mathematical proof of a
      claim. First, it should provide an <em class="boldtoo">explanation</em>
      that will help the reader understand on an intuitive level why the given
      claim is true. Second, it must be <em class="boldtoo">objective</em>. The
      veracity and correctness of the proof should not depend on subjective
      opinion of anyone.</p>

      <p>But these two claims are sometimes not mutually compatible. What if
      two people have a different intuitive impression of the same claim? One
      intuitively believes it is true, another believes it is false? How can we
      referee such a situation to maintain the objective nature of our
      mathematical results? How can we achieve objectivity in our proofs?</p>

      <p>One solution is to take intuition and subjectivity out of the picture
      completely by devising a completely <em>algorithmic</em> mechanism for
      determining if our proof is correct. If a machine, an electromechanical
      device with presumably no intuition whatsoever can verify that our proof
      is correct, then we can be confident that no personal subjective bias or
      intuition is required. Proofs of this sort, which can be verified
      algorithmically by a computer (in theory) in a finite amount of time are
      often referred to as <em>formal proofs</em>.</p>

      <p>One drawback to formal proofs is that they can be quite lengthy and
      detailed and tedious, sometimes obscuring the intuitive understanding we
      wish to achieve with our proofs. Most of the mathematical proofs found in
      math textbooks and journals are not formal proofs. Instead an experienced
      mathematician tries to convey to his audience two things: (1) a lucid
      intuitive explanation of why the claim being proved must be valid and (b)
      enough details about the key steps in a formal proof of the claim that
      his audience could, if needed, produce a formal proof of the statement.
      Thus, a typical mathematician uses many shortcuts and convenience
      conventions to convey to give his proofs the brevity and clarity needed
      for intuitive understanding of the proof, while providing sufficient
      information to reconstruct a formal proof of the same claim, thus
      effectively providing the objective certainty we also demand.</p>

      <p>In this introduction to mathematical proofs, we will first introduce
      you to formal proofs, and then later add shortcuts and convenient
      conventions that allow you to slowly make the transition from formal
      proofs to the standard kinds of mathematical proofs found in books and
      journals. In this way you will first gain a solid, rigorous, objective
      method of constructing proofs, and later relax the formality to obtain
      more intuitive informal mathematical proofs. Having a bridge between
      these two types of proofs, by having a formal proof skeleton and a
      repertoire of rigorous, well-defined shortcuts for making them more human
      readable and intuitive, will allow the best of both worlds in our proofs:
      intuitive understanding and objective certainty.</p>

      <h2>Toy Proofs!</h2>

      <p>As you might expect, formal mathematical proofs can be somewhat
      complicated beasties. Thus, we begin by introducing smaller "Toy" proof
      systems that illustrate some of the basic features of a real formal proof
      system, but do it in small incremental steps that illustrate the common
      mechanisms involved.</p>

      <p>In some sense making a formal proof is like playing a game. The kinds
      of games we have in mind have the following features in common.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Toys:</b> These are the objects you play with in your game. Toys
        can be anything: a single number, a list of numbers, a word, a
        sentence, a geometric shape, a mathematical statement like
        <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>z</i><sup>2</sup>, an
        assumption, a color. (<i>In a formal mathematics proof the toys are
        usually mathematical statements.</i>)</li>

        <li><b>A Goal:</b> The game must have a special toy called the goal.
        The object of the game is to produce that particular goal toy. If you
        successfully produce the goal, you win! (<i>In a formal mathematics
        proof the goal is the statement that you are trying to prove.</i>)</li>

        <li><b>The Starting Position:</b> The game provides you with zero or
        more toys to start with that you can use to build other toys. (<i>In a
        formal mathematics proof these are the 'Givens' or hypotheses.</i>)
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The Rules:</b> What would a game be without rules? This is a set
          of one or more rules that allow you to construct other toys in the
          game from the toys that you already have and other information. The
          essential feature that all such rules must have is that the are
          completely precise, unambiguous, and algorithmic in nature. (<i>In a
          formal mathematics proof these are the rules of inference that are
          used to deduce that one statement follows from other statements.</i>)
          Each such rule will have the following features.

          <ul>
            <li><b>Inputs:</b> The inputs usually consist of zero or more toys
            that you already have available (either because you constructed
            them or they were given to you as part of the Starting Position)
            and other information that you might provide.</li>

            <li><b>Output:</b> The output usually consists of a single toy that
            is produced by the rule. We say that such a toy have been
            'constructed' or 'justified' by the rule and is then usually 
            added to your collection of available toys.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each of these aspects are illustrated in the games that follow.</p>

      <h2>Let's Play!</h2>

      <p>In this collection there are currently three games: Scrambler!,
      TrixGame, and Circle-Dot. You can read the help file for each game before
      you begin if you wish, but they are fairly self-explanatory if you want
      to dive right in and try them. Each illustrates the concept of a formal
      proof in a way that is simpler than what you will encounter when you do
      actual formal mathematical proofs. There is also some sophisticated
      mathematics hidden behind the first two games. Beware - all three games
      can be quite addictive!</p>
