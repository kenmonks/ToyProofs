      <h1>Make Numbers. Win Prizes. Get Famous.</h1>

      <p>Welcome to TriX Game! The object of the game is to produce a single
      number. You always start with the number 1. On each of your turns you can
      apply one of two rules to your current number to construct another
      number, which becomes your new current number. The rules are called
      Inflate and Deflate, but we won't ruin your fun by telling you what they
      do. (You can easily figure that out by experimentation.)</p>

      <p>It may require some study and investigation on your part to come up
      with an efficient strategy for beating this game at the higher levels of
      difficulty. (The level of difficulty corresponds roughly to the minimum
      number of turns required to win the game.)</p>

      <h2>Game Components</h2>

      <p>As described in the <a href='Introduction.html'>Introduction</a>, this
      game illustrates the basic features of a formal proof system.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Toys:</b> The toys in this game consist of a single positive
        whole number.</li>

        <li><b>A Goal:</b> The goal is a randomly selected positive number.
        Your objective is to construct this number.</li>

        <li><b>The Starting Position:</b> The starting position in this game is
        the number 1. This is the only toy on your list when you begin the
        game.</li>

        <li>
          <b>The Rules:</b> There are two legal moves in this game called
          <i>Inflate</i> and <i>Deflate</i>. It is up to you to determine what
          they do. Note that you can always Inflate your current number but you
          can only Deflate certain numbers.

          <ul>
            <li><b>Inputs:</b> The input for both Rules consists of the current
            number. The current number is always the last number listed on the
            table. You can undo a move and go back to a previously constructed
            number by pressing <i>U</i></li>

            <li><b>Output:</b> The output is the number produced by either
            Inflating or Deflating the current number. This number is added to
            the bottom of the list and becomes the current number. If it
            matches the goal, you win!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Math Behind the Fun</h2>

      <p>This game is closely related to a famous unsolved question in
      mathematics. In particular, it is not known whether this game can be won
      for EVERY positive whole number goal. It has been demonstrated by
      computer that this game can be won for all goal numbers less than
      $10^{17}$. If you can prove that there is a strategy for winning
      this game there are cash prizes available and you will certainly become
      famous! Remember that it isn't enough to come up with a strategy that
      seems to win every time you play the game, you must prove beyond a doubt
      that your strategy would win the game no matter what positive whole
      number is selected as the goal (even if the number is too large to
      actually fit in a computer).</p>
